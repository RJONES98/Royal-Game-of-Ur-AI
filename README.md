# Royal-Game-of-Ur-AI
Final year research project at Durham University Engineering Department training an AI to play the ancient game and extracting the strategies it employs

The AI was trained using a version of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method combined with the PUCT formula for calculating the upper confidence bound, utilised by DeepMind in a number of their projects. For extraction of results, statistical analysis of moves was performed along with observing the win rate when modifying game starting positions and decision making. The project is now under review with the aim of publishing within 2 years.
